## Analysis

```{r}
loadd(histogram_plot)
loadd(histogram_data)
```
On most *nix systems, the file `/usr/share/dict/words` contains a bunch of words. On my machine, it contains `r sum(histogram_data$Freq)` words.

I computed the length of each word, i.e. the number of characters, and tabulated how many words consist of 1 character, 2 characters, etc.

The most frequent word length is `r with(histogram_data, Length[which.max(Freq)])`.

Here is a histogram of word lengths.

```{r, fig.cap = "*Fig. 1* A histogram of English word lengths"}
histogram_plot
```
